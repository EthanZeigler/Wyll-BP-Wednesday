# Wyll's Block Party Wednesday Modpack

A private (and opinionated) kitchen sink modpack amongst friends.

## Install

This uses packwiz. There's boilerplate here that could be written but I don't know where to look.

## Usage

Install the .mrpack in your preferred third-party Minecraft Launcher and hope the args come with the packwiz-installer.
